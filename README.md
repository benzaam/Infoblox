# Infoblox ActiveTrust Cloud Security Report for Reporting & Analytics

This Splunk dashboard is a modified version of offical Splunk App for Infoblox ActiveTrust Cloud (available [here](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3850/)) that works out of the box with [Infoblox Reporting & Analytics](https://www.infoblox.com/products/reporting-analytics/).

With this XML file, you don't need to have a separate Splunk running.
